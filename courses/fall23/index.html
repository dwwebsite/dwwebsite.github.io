<h2>Course Overview</h2>

<p>Just as Internet changed the way people interact with each other, social sensing and human cyber-physical systems (H-CPS) are changing <i>the way people interact with the world, both physically and socially!</i> Social sensing and H-CPS integrate sensing, computation, control and networking into physical objects and infrastructure, connecting them to the Internet and to each other. This course offers students the opportunity to learn the theoretical foundations, state-of-the-art techniques, emerging applications, and hands-on experience in this emerging area.  The advances in such an area hold the potential to reshape our world with more responsive, precise, reliable and efficient systems, enabling a revolution of “smart” devices and paradigms – from smart cars to smart grids to smart cities, collectively giving rise to the smart planet – that can address some of our most pressing national priorities (e.g., health, energy, climate, science & technology, security, etc.). Some example topics of the course include: i) fighting information overload in online social media sensing (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, Reddit); ii) data reliability and information trustworthiness issues (e.g., truth discovery, misinformation detection and explanation); iii) mobile and crowdsensing (e.g., smartphone-based sensing); iv) privacy, medical sensing and applications. The students will have the opportunities to work with real world social sensing and H-CPS problems in a semester-long course project.

<h2> Grading </h2>
 
<dir>
<li> 
20% of the grade will be assigned on individuals' active class participation and discussion of lecture topics, in-class paper and project presentations. Attendance/camera-on is recorded in Zoom and will be used in final participation grade calculation. 
<p>

<li> 
30% of the grade will be assigned on in-class paper presentations on the selected topic by each student.  
<p>

<!-- <li> 
30% of the grade will be assigned on individuals' homework assignments. (Individual-based)
<p> -->



<li> 
50% of the grade will be determined by a course project. This grade includes project proposal, mid-term report, mid-term project presentation, a final project presentation, a final project paper, and project roundtable discussions. The project will implement some innovative social sensing model, service, system, or computing environment.

<!-- <b> Note: </b> For individual based work, each student will receive the credit based on her/his own work. For the group based work, every student in the group will receive the same credit based on the group's work. However, an <b>optional peer-evaluation form</b> will be provided to evaluate the contribution of individual members by other members in the same group. If evidence (e.g., code commit/document edit/email history) from the peer evaluation reflects that a member did not contribute sufficiently to the group project, the grade of that member will be adjusted accordingly.   -->
<!--
<p>
Final grade will be decided on a fixed scale:
</p> 

<li>	93 - 100:	 A
<li>	88 - 92.9:	 A-
<li>	85 - 87.9: 	B+
<li>	82 - 84.9: 	B
<li>	78 - 81.9:	B-
<li>	74 - 77.9:	C+
<li>	70 - 73.9:	C

<h2>Course Project</h2>

<dir>
<li>	
The project (individual-based) will be chosen by each student within the first couple of weeks of class. Here are <a href=https://canvas.illinois.edu/courses/37610/pages/course-project-for-social-sensing-and-h-cps><b>some ideas</b></a> to help you get started. Students are encouraged to come up with their own ideas. If you have some really cool idea that does not satisfy such restriction, please schedule a meeting to discuss it with the instructor. <b> Project title and abstract are due on Sep. 1 at 11:59 pm.</b> 
<p>

<!-- <li>	
Each group will schedule a regular meeting (during project meeting slots and office hours) to meet with the instructor and discuss the progress and problems encountered on their projects. 
<p> -->
 
<li> 
Each student will prepare and submit a two-page project proposal. The proposal should include an overview of the project (preferably with a diagram), a brief review of state-of-the-arts in related fields, the proposed method/solution, a credible set of initial project results if available, a list of further proposed milestones, and a plan of action for the rest of the semester. <b> The proposal is due on Sep. 29 at 11:59 pm. </b>
<p>



<li> 
Each student is responsible for <b> a Mid-term Project Presentation in class on Oct. 16. </b> The presentation will allow the instructor and classmates to comment on the initial results and current state of the project and also give constructive feedback to the group members. 
<p>


<li> 
Each student will prepare and submit a four-page mid-term project report. The mid-term report should include a reasonable amount of preliminary results, a description of finished milestones, a discussion of encountered problems and relevant solutions, and any modifications to the plan (if there are) to finish the remaining tasks. <b> The mid-term report is due on Oct. 20 at 11:59 pm.</b> 
<p>
 
<li>
<b> Final project presentations </b> will be conducted by each student during the lecture <b>on Dec. 4.</b>
<p>
 
<li> 
Each student will prepare and submit a final project paper. The final project paper is a comprehensive summary of the whole project and should follow a technical paper writing style. The expected number of pages for the final paper is 8-10 pages (including references). <b> Final project paper is due on Dec. 11 at 11:59 pm.</b>
<p>

<li>
The proposal, mid-term report and final project paper should all follow a <b> standard technical paper format</b>. Here is the template: <a href="http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html"> IEEE Latex or Word Template </a>. 
<p>

<li> 
A successful project could result in a conference or journal quality paper.
<p>

You are encouraged to seek out and exploit external manuals, books, websites, and other documentation that can help you to complete your project, provided that you indicate what sources you have used. However, all software development, experimental work, and writing of the proposal, report and paper must be done solely by your own.
