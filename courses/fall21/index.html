<h2>Course Overview</h2>

Online social media (e.g., Twitter, Facebook), smartphones, and ubiquitous internet connectivity have greatly facilitated data sharing at scale, allowing for a firehose of human and sensor observations to pour in about the physical world in real-time. This opens up unprecedented challenges and opportunities in the field of <i>social sensing and human-centric cyber-physical systems (H-CPS) </i> where an important goal is to efficiently organize the real-time data feeds and accurately reconstruct the "states of the world", both physical and social. This course offers students the opportunity to learn the theoretical foundations, state-of-the-art techniques, and hands-on experience in this exciting area. The topic of this class is timely due to the increasing interest in online social networks, big data, and human-in-the-loop systems, as well as the proliferation of computing artifacts that interact with or monitor the physical world. 
<p>
The class contains four main components: (i) the introduction to social sensing and cyber-physical systems; (ii) key technical challenges (e.g., big data analytics, system reliability, user mobility, energy, privacy, etc.); (iii) state-of-the-art techniques and systems (e.g., MapReduce/Hadoop, fact-finding, etc);  (iv) emerging applications (smartphone-based crowdsensing, online social media sensing, participatory/opportunistic sensing, intelligent transportation, smart buildings, body area networks etc). The students will have the opportunities to work with real world social sensing and cyber-physical system problems.

<h2> Grading </h2>
 
<dir>
<li> 
10% of the grade will be assigned on individuals' class participation and proactive discussion of lecture topics and project presentations. (Individual based)
<p>

<li> 
10% of the grade will be assigned on an in-class paper presentation on the selected topic by each group. (Group based)
<p>

<li> 
30% of the grade will be assigned on individuals' homework assignments. (Individual based)
<p>



<li> 
50% of the grade will be determined by a group course project. This grade includes project proposal, mid-term report, mid-term project presentation, a final project presentation, a final project paper, and project updates and demonstrations (to the instructor). The project will implement some innovative social sensing model, service, system, or computing environment. Students will be allowed to work in groups of 1 or 2 on the project. The project will proceed through the landmarks stated below. (Group based)
<p>


<dir>
<li>

<h2><a href=project/project.html> Course Project</a> </h2>

<dir>
<li>	
The project will be chosen by each group within the first couple of weeks of class.  Here are <a href=project/project.html> <b> some ideas </b> </a> to help you get started. Groups are encouraged to come up with their own ideas. If you have some really cool idea that does not satisfy such restriction, please schedule a meeting to discuss it with the instructor. <b> Project title, abstract, and member list are due on Noon, Sep. 3.</b> 
<p>

<!-- The <b> only restriction of the project </b> is that it should use online social media data (e.g., Twitter, Flickr, Foursquare, Facebook, etc.) to solve some interesting problem in social sensing.-->

<li>	
Each group will schedule a regular meeting (during project meeting slots and office hours) to meet with the instructor and discuss the progress and problems encountered on their projects. 
<p>
 
<li> 
Each group will prepare and submit a two page project proposal. The proposal should include an overview of the project (preferably with a diagram), a brief review of state-of-the-arts in related fields, the proposed method/solution, a credible set of initial project results if available, a list of further proposed milestones, and a plan of action for the rest of the semester. <b> The proposal is due on Noon, Oct. 1. </b>
<p>



<li> 
Each group is responsible for <b> a Mid-term Project Presentation in class starting from Oct. 18. </b> The presentation will allow the instructor and classmates to comment on the initial results and current state of the project and also give constructive feedback to the group members. 
<p>


<li> 
Each group will prepare and submit a three page mid-term project report. The mid-term report should include a reasonable amount of preliminary results, a description of finished milestones, a discussion of encountered problems and relevant solutions, and any modifications to the plan (if there are) to finish the remaining tasks. <b> The mid-term report is due on Noon, Oct. 22.</b> 
<p>
 
<li>
<b> Final project presentations </b> will be conducted by each group in <b>the week of Dec. 13.</b>
<p>
 
<li> 
Each group will prepare and submit a final project paper. The final project paper is a comprehensive summary of the whole project and should follow a technical paper writing style. The expected number of pages for the final paper is 5 to 8 pages (including references). <b> Final project paper is due on Noon, Dec. 17.</b>
<p>

<li>
The proposal, mid-term report and final project paper should all follow a <b> standard technical paper format </b>. Here is the template: <a href="http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html"> IEEE Latex or Word Template </a>. 
<p>

<li> 
A successful project could result in a conference or journal quality paper.
<p>

<b> Note </b>: For more information about the project (e.g., possible ideas and milestones), please visit <a href=project/project.html> <b> Course Project Page </b> </a><br> 

<p>
You are encouraged to seek out and exploit external manuals, books, websites, and other documentation that can help you to complete your project, provided that you indicate what sources you have used. However, all software development, experimental work, and writing of the proposal, report and paper must be done solely by you and your project partner(s).
<br>
<br>

</dir>
<b> <i>Project Documents Submission Instruction: </i> To submit the project related documents (i.e., abstract, proposal, midterm/final presentation slides and reports), please (1) <u> email the document (i.e., pdf for text documents and pptx/pdf for slides) directly to Prof. Wang before the deadline; </u> (2) upload a copy of the submission to Canvas as a backup. One submission per group is sufficient. </b> </a><br>

<h2>Assignments</h2>

<p>
 Assignments are normally due at the <b> beginning  of class on the date due </b>. This might change due to the break (e.g., Fall Break). Please double check with the assignment description and the course website for the actual due date. Late assignments will receive no credit. This includes assignments submitted after class has begun. 

<p>
 <!-- Programming assignments will be turned in electronically by copying all required files to a "dropbox" directory. You are free to turn in assignments multiple times before the deadline expires. It would be a good habit to turn in an incomplete but working assignment on a daily basis. Thus, there is no excuse for failing to turn in an assignment: everyone should turn in something long before the deadline. Exceptions will be made only in grave circumstances. -->
