<h2>Final Project Presentations</h2>

In the week of Dec. 6 of class, you will give a final presentation
on your project. In the presentation, you should be able to demonstrate all the accomplishments of your project with a focus on the ones you have achieved after the mid-term presentation. 

<p>
Each talk will occupy <b> 20-25 minutes, </b> followed by <b> 5-10 minutes </b> for questions, comments, discussions and feedback.
Given the time limit, you must  stick carefully to your message, and practice your talk multiple times. While the team work is appreciated, all team members are expected to speak during the presentation. 
Since it is the final presentation, please make it comprehensive and discuss all essential parts of your projects with an emphasize on the results you obtained in the second of half of the semester.
<p>
Your talk should be accompanied by <b>20-25 carefully prepared slides</b>.
You may use any tool that you like to create slides, <b> please send me the final version of your slides by Noon of Dec. 6</b>. You are also highly encouraged to do a demo of your project in the final presentation.

<!--<p>
Use your slides to <b>back up</b> what you say to the audience.  Don't just write out the words that you plan to say; that gets odd quickly.  Instead, give a diagram of the components of your system and describe how they interact.
Or, give a screenshot of your system in action and explain what it is doing.
Or, give a code snippet on the screen and explain what is interesting about it.
-->
<p>
A typical structure of the talk would include: A brief review of the project background, Progresses made after mid-term report, Final evaluation results and demo (if there is one), Experience and Lessons Learned. 
</p>

<b> Please do a few dry runs as a group to make sure the presentation flows well and meets the above time requirement. </b>

<p>
Finally, be considerate of your classmates -- be present at all of the
class sessions, ask thoughtful questions about these exciting
projects and finish an evaluation/feedback form of all presentations except your own. 


<p>
<b> Final Report: please upload your final report to Canvas by Noon, Dec. 13. </b> </b> See instructions on <a href=../project/project.html>Project Webpage</a>.
</p>

<!-- An attendance sheet will be circulated. -->
