<h2>Final Project Presentations</h2>

In the week of Dec. 13 of class, you will give a final presentation
on your project to Prof. Wang on your scheduled slot. In the presentation, you should be able to demonstrate all the accomplishments of your project with a focus on the ones you have achieved after the mid-term presentation. 

<p>
<b> Presentation Mode (Please choose one): 

<dir>
	<li> Online: Please go to Zoom meeting at the scheduled time slot (see below) to do the live presentation. 
	<li> Offline: Please email me i) your decision by Dec. 10, and ii) our final slides and the link to your pre-recorded presentation by your scheduled presentation day. 
</dir>
</b> 
You are only required to come to your presentation slot but you are welcome to attend other groups' presentations if you are interested.  

<p>
Each talk will occupy <b> 7 minutes, </b> followed by <b> 2 minutes </b> for questions, comments, discussions and feedback.
Given the time limit, you must  stick carefully to your message, and practice your talk multiple times. While the team work is appreciated, only one member is required to speak during the presentation. 
Since it is the final presentation, please make it comprehensive and discuss all essential parts of your projects with an emphasize on the results you obtained in the second of half of the semester.
<p>
Your talk should be accompanied by <b>5-7 carefully prepared slides</b>.
You may use any tool that you like to create slides, <b> please send me the final version of your slides by Noon of your presentation day</b>. You are also highly encouraged to do a demo of your project in the final presentation.

<!--<p>
Use your slides to <b>back up</b> what you say to the audience.  Don't just write out the words that you plan to say; that gets odd quickly.  Instead, give a diagram of the components of your system and describe how they interact.
Or, give a screenshot of your system in action and explain what it is doing.
Or, give a code snippet on the screen and explain what is interesting about it.
-->
<p>
A typical structure of the talk would include: A brief review of the project background, Progresses made after mid-term report, Final evaluation results and demo (if there is one), Experience and Lessons Learned. 
</p>

<p>
<b> Final Report: please send me your final report by Noon, Dec. 17. </b>
</p>

<!-- An attendance sheet will be circulated. -->

<h2>Grading</h2>

Your grade will be based on the following rubric:

<dir>
<li> Does the presentation adequately cover all aspects 
of the project: the objective or problem to be solved,
the structure and technologies used, one or more
interesting challenges, comprehensive evaluation, and meaningful conclusions?

<li> Has progress on the project been made after mid-term presentation/report, including new results that have not been discussed in mid-term presentation/report?

<li> Are the slides prepared with care, including at least
one excellent diagram that shows the structure of the system
and how the components interact?

<li> Is the oral presentation clear, logical, and completed within the time limit?
