<h2>In-class Paper Presentations</h2>

In the week of Nov. 15, each group will give an oral presentation on a selected paper in social sensing and H-CPS. For the paper to be presented, you can select it from any paper listed in "medical sensing and privacy issues" (i.e., the week of Nov. 15) on the course website or any other research papers that fall into the scope of social sensing and human-cyber-physical systems. <b> You need to confirm with the instructor about your selected paper.</b>  If two groups happen to select the same paper, the group who confirms with the instructor earlier has the priority to keep their choice and the other group will need to select a different paper. So please confirm with the instructor at your earliest convenience. The <b> deadline </b> to confirm with the instructor about the presentation paper is <b> Friday, Oct. 29.</b>


<p>
Each talk will occupy <b> 20-25 minutes,</b> followed by <b> 5-10 minutes </b> for questions, comments, and transition.
Given the time limit, you must stick carefully to your message, and practice your talk multiple times
with your group members. Each team member should speak for a portion of the presentation time. 
Keep in mind that you are <b> not </b> the authors of the paper, so you do not need to defend everything presented in the paper. Instead, try to exercise your critical thinking ability and make the presentation <b> interactive</b>. For example you can prepare some intriguing questions and sample the opinions from the class. You can also design and lead a mini-discussion-session on a few important limitations you find about the paper.  Please also note that your classmates might not read the paper before, so please make sure you provide them with enough information about the paper so they feel comfortable to answer your questions.


<p>
Your talk should be accompanied by <b> 15-20 carefully prepared slides</b>.
You may use any tool that you like to create slides, but you are recommended to
email a draft of your slides to me in <b>PDF</b> or <b>PPTX</b> format by <b>Wednesday Nov. 10, Noon</b> so that I can take a look and give you some feedback if needed. After that, please email me the final version of your slides by <b> Noon on the day of your presentation</b>. <!-- 
(There won't be time for mucking around with laptops, cables, etc.) 
 -->
<p>
A typical structure of the talk would include: Background/Introduction, Challenges, Solutions, Evaluations and Discussions, Limitations and Future Work.

<p>
Finally, be considerate of your classmates -- be present at all of the
class sessions, actively get involved in the class discussion and finish an evaluation/feedback form of all presentations except your own. 

<!-- An attendance sheet will be circulated. -->

<h2>Grading</h2>

Your grade will be based on the following rubric:

<dir>
<li> Does the presentation reflect the group's critical thinking ability?

<li> Has the group read the paper carefully and prepared the presentation well?

<li> Is the presentation interactive? Is the discussion part well organized?

<li> Is the oral presentation clear and logical, with each group member participating, and completing the presentation within the time limit?

<li> Did the project members attend everyone else's talks, ask appropriate questions and give helpful feedback?
