<h2>Background</h2>

In this programming assignment, you will implement the client and server sides of a simple File Transfer Protocol (FTP) application. 
<font color="black">The file transfer itself will take place using <b>TCP</b> with the client determining the operation to be performed (creating a file, deleting a file, creating a new directory, removing a directory, changing to a different directory, obtaining a directory listing, or closing the connection). </font>
The server should respond appropriately to the specific command. The specifics of the protocol are detailed in this document. <b><i>Note: please refer to appendix A for the port number assigned to you (the same as PG1).</i></b>

<br><br>



<h2>Problem:</h2>

<font color="black">
<h3>Part 1: TCP Practice</h3>


In the first part of this assignment, you are asked to build a simple TCP server and client where the client can successfully 1) establish the connection with the server, and 2) send a string (e.g., "Hello World") to the client. The finished code for Part 1 can also be used for Part 2 of this assignment. <br><br>


We have provided an <b>optional</b> starter skeleton code to get you started on the right track. 
The starter code files (i.e., tcpserver.py and tcpclient.py) can be downloaded from <a href="https://canvas.illinois.edu/courses/16629/files/3710264">here</a>. 


</font>

<h3>Part 2:  Simple File Transfer Protocol </h3>

<ol>

<li>Server opens the port, and goes into "wait for connection" state.</li>

<li>Client connects to the server on the appropriate port.</li>

<li>Server goes into "wait for operation from client" state and waits for operation command from the client.</li>

<li>Client goes into "prompt user for operation" state and prompts user for operation.</li>

<li>
  <font color="black">Client passes operation (<b>DN</b>: Download, <b>UP</b>: Upload, 
  <!-- <b>HEAD</b>: Head of File,  -->
  <b>RM</b>: Remove File, <b>LS</b>: List, <b>MKDIR</b>: Make Directory, <b>RMDIR</b>: Remove Directory, <b>CD</b>: Change Directory, <b>QUIT</b>: Quit) to server. </font>

<li>Client sends the <b>length of the filename</b>  (short int) followed by the <b>filename</b> (character string).</li>

<li>Server decodes what it receives, and checks to see if the file exists in its local directory.

<h3>General Notes</h3>

<ul>

<li>Your code may be written in Python. You should create two separate directories: 
  <!-- under the <b><code><font color="black
  ">/mnt/efs/fs1/dropbox/yournetid/program2/</font></code></b> directory,  -->
  a <b>server</b> directory for the server code and a <b>client</b> directory for the client code.
</li>

<li>
Please also specify your Python version in your readme file if your code is written a version different from Python 3.8.
</li>

<li>The request for a file is transmitted using a 16-bit value (short int -  containing the length of the filename) followed by a string which contains the name of the file.  When sending a file to the server, you need to send a 16-bit value (short int) followed by the filename to the server.</li>

<li><font color="black
">Don't forget that the <b>Endian-ness matters.</b> Use <code style="background-color:#eee;">htons/ntohs</code> and/or <code style="background-color:#eee;">struct.pack()/struct.unpack()</code> in order to encode a 16 bit (short) value for transmission. Use <code style="background-color:#eee;">htonl/ntohl</code> and/or <code style="background-color:#eee;">struct.pack()/struct.unpack()</code> for 32-bit (int) values.</font></li>

<li><font color="black
">You need to display the throughput for the file transfer. Throughput will be part of your grade.  Most likely, you will want to use <code style="background-color:#eee;">time.time()</code>, which will allow you to keep track of accuracy at the microsecond level.</font> 
</li>

<li>To determine the size of files, <font color="black
">you may want to use the <code style="background-color:#eee;">os.stat(filename).st_size</code> or equivalent functions.</font> For efficiency reasons you probably should not "roll your own".</li>

<li>When in doubt, add in extra print statements to assist with debugging. Make sure to add in a carriage return to ensure that debug information is displayed before program crashes occur. <b>Make sure to disable your debugging output before handing in the assignment.</b> </li>

<li>You can connect back to localhost (127.0.0.1) which will allow you to test your code on the same machine where you have the server running. Create a separate ssh terminal session back to the server and then run your client code by connecting to localhost. <b> But make sure you have tested your solution on two different student machines before submission.</b> </li>

<li><font color="black"> We provided a file TestFile.txt (1KB) (<a href="https://canvas.illinois.edu/courses/16629/files/3710264">download</a>) which will be used to test the <b>DN</b> operation. </font></li>


</ul>

<h3>FTP - Server Side Design</h3>

The server is responsible for handling the connection request from a single client, processing the request, then looping back to handle further requests. For this particular assignment, your code only needs to handle one client at a time. 
<!-- The server executable should be named <b><code style="background-color:#eee;">myftpd.py</code></b>.<br><br> -->

The server should listen on the <b>specified port number [the port number assigned to any of your group members]</b> that is given by command line argument. Your server should bind to the port and then listen for incoming client connections. You may decide if you would like to allow timeouts for better responsiveness but any sort of a timeout is purely optional. You may want to allow for port reuse for quicker recovery after a crash.<br><br>

Once a new client request arrives, your server should  use the accept function to create a new client socket.  Once the file has been transmitted, return to the state where your server is waiting for a new command. 



Your server should be invoked as follows:<br><br>

<font color="black"> <code style="background-color:#eee; font-size:14px"><b>[</b>netid@is-student00 <b>~] $ python3 tcpserver.py [Port]</b></code></font>

<h3>FTP - Client Side Design</h3>

The client is responsible for initiating a connection to a server.  Once connected, the client code should prompt the user for an operation (<b>DN, UP, RM, LS, MKDIR, RMDIR, CD, QUIT</b>), and should transmit the operation to the server.  
<!-- Your client executable should be named <b><code style="background-color:#eee;">myftp.py</code></b>.   -->
Your client should be invoked as follows:<br><br>

<font color="black"><code style="background-color:#eee; font-size:14px"><b>[</b>netid@is-student02 <b>~] $ python3 tcpclient.py [Server Name] [Port]</b></code></font>



<br><br>

The first argument is the hostname of the server to connect to (this will depend on what machine you start 

your server code on).  The second argument is the port number.<br><br>

Once a transfer completes successfully, you need to display the throughput for the transfer.  You should display 

information similar to the following for each file transfer (<b>DN/UP</b>):<br><br>



<code>99 bytes transferred in 0.029757 seconds: 0.003326 Megabytes/sec<br></code>

<h2>Extra Credits</h2>
<font color="black">
<ol>
  <li><b>Download Large Files:</b> The client will be able to download large files (in several MB) from the server. In particular, when the client receives the large file from the server, it will need to enter a loop to receive the entire file in multiple rounds. In each round, the client will be able to write the data up to the buffer size (e.g., 4096). <br>
    <b>Note:</b> You will need take into consideration the <b>return value</b> from reading the socket. The system may <b>not</b> provide the same number of bytes as you requested to fill the buffer. We provided a large files, LargeFile.mp4 (44MB) (<a href="https://canvas.illinois.edu/courses/16629/files/3709881">download</a>), which will be used to test the <b>DN</b> operation. 
  </li>

    
  <li><b>MD5 Hash for Data Integrity:</b> You will need to calculate the MD5 hash of the transferred file for data integrity purpose. Whenever you send a file (through <b>UP</b> or <b>DN</b>), calculate the MD5 hash on both the sending and receiving ends. 

    <ul>
      <li><b>Download (DN)</b>: The server will send the calculated MD5 hash to the client. The client will compare the received MD5 hash and the MD5 hash calculated from the received file. If the MD5 hash matches, the client will print a confirmation message with the MD5 hash. Otherwise, the client will display an error message. 

      <li><b>Upload (UP)</b>: The client will send the calculated MD5 hash to the server. The server will compare the received MD5 hash and the MD5 hash calculated from the received file. If the MD5 hash matches, the server will send a confirmation message to the client. Otherwise, the server will send an error message. The client receives the message, and displays it to the user. If the MD5 hash matches, the client will also display the MD5 hash. 
    </ul>

   
    <b>Note:</b> The MD5 hash is to be calculated with the md5sum command line utility. The syntax is <code style="background-color:#eee;">md5sum filename</code> to obtain the hash as a string (in hex). You can find more information about MD5 Hash at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5">Wikipedia Link.</a></li>
