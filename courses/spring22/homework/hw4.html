<h2>Problems</h2>

<!-- <b>Problem 1: [15 points]</b> Suppose the fragments of a packet as shown in the following figure all pass through a router onto a link with an MTU of 252 bytes. Show the fragments produced. If the packet was originally fragmented for this MTU, how many fragments would be produced?
Note: The MTU includes the IP header (20 bytes) and the IP datagram payload.

<b>Problem 1: [25 points, 5 points for each sub-question]</b> 
Suppose a router has built up the routing table shown in the table below.
The router can deliver packets directly over interfaces 0 and 1, or it can forward packets to
routers R2, R3 or R4. Describe what the router does with a packet addressed to each of the
following destinations:

<ol>
  <li type="a">192.64.73.161</li> <br>
  <li type="a">128.65.71.16</li><br>
  <li type="a">128.64.71.88</li><br>
  <li type="a">192.13.155.17</li><br>
  <li type="a">192.13.155.156</li><br>
</ol>

<br><br>
<b>Problem 2: [24 points, 8 points for each sub-question] </b> For the network given as follows, give the global distance vector tables when using the Distance Vector Routing Algorithm for the following three instances. (See tables 3.10 and 3.13 in the textbook as examples.)
<ol>
  <li type="a">Each node knows only the distances to its immediate neighbors</li> <br>
  <li type="a">Each node has reported the information it had in the preceding step to its immediate neighbors</li><br>
  <li type="a">Step (b) happens a second time</li><br>
</ol>

<b>Problem 3: [21 points] </b> For the network given as follows, show how the link-state algorithm builds the routing table for node A.

<!-- <b>Problem 4: [10 points]</b> What is the end-to-end argument in network system design? Give an example we studied in lectures that does not exactly follow this argument and explain why.
