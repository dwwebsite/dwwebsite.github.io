<h2>Problems</h2>


<b>Problem 1: [10 points]</b> What is the MAC protocol of Ethernet and describe how it works using your own words. Does Wireless MAC protocol use "collision detection"? If yes, explain why. If not, explain why not.
<br><br>

<b>Problem 2: [10 points]</b> What is a hidden terminal problem? How is the hidden terminal problem addressed in 802.11 networks?
<br><br>


<!-- <b>Problem 3: [30 points, 5 points for each sub-question]</b>
Using the example network below, give the virtual circuit table for all the switches after each of the following connections is established. Assume that the sequence of connections is cumulative; that is, the first connection is still up when the second connection is established, and so on. Also, assume that the VCI assignment always picks the lowest unused VCI on each link, starting with 0, and that VCI is consumed for both directions of a virtual circuit.

  <li type="a">Host A connects to host I</li><br>
  <li type="a">Host F connects to host B</li><br>
  <li type="a">Host J connects to host C</li><br>
  <li type="a">Host G connects to host D</li>

<b>Problem 3: [32 points, 8 points for each switch's forwarding table] </b>
Consider the arrangement of learning bridges shown in the following figure. Assuming all are initially empty, give the forwarding tables for each of the bridges B1-B4 after the following transmissions:
<b>(Note: You only need to show the final forwarding tables after all three transmissions: A->C, C->A, D->C). </b>

<ul>
  <li>A sends to C</li><br>
  <li>C sends to A</li><br>
  <li>D sends to C</li>
</ul>

<br><br>
<b>Problem 4: [18 points]</b> Suppose the fragments of a packet as shown in the following figure all pass through a router onto a link with an MTU of 252 bytes. Show the fragments produced. If the packet was originally fragmented for this MTU, how many fragments would be produced?
Note: The MTU includes the IP header (20 bytes) and the IP datagram payload.

<b>Problem 5:  [18 points: 10 points for the correct spanning tree; 8 points for the correct explanation]</b>  Given the extended LAN shown in the following figure, indicate which ports are not selected by the spanning tree algorithm. (Please also explain how you decide which port in the extended LAN will not be used in the spanning tree. A correct spanning tree without explanation will only get half credits). 
<br>

<br><br>
<b>Problem 6: [6 points] </b>
 Give the spanning tree generated for the extended LAN shown in the following figure, and discuss how ties are resolved.(Note: "discuss how ties are resolved" means: draw all possible spanning trees if any tie exists when you build the spanning tree of the extended LAN).
