<h2>Getting Help</h2>

<dir>
<li> <a href=https://piazza.com/nd/fall2014/cse40822>Piazza Discussion Page</a> - The best place for technical questions like "What does this error message mean?"
<li> <b>Office Hours</b> - One of the instructors is available each afternoon Mon-Thu.
<li> <b>Email</b> - Contact Prof. Thain for questions about grades, course policies, etc.
<li> <a href=https://sakailogin.nd.edu/portal/site/5b3f855e-c443-4cc2-80b7-f9c5fdbaeae6/page/77821524-45ba-4d4c-a0f2-3f45e77d3dca>Recorded Lectures</a> are available on Sakai.  Recordings are good for reviewing what happened, but not as good as being there in person!

<h2>Call For Papers <b><a href=./CFP2.pdf>(PDF)</a></b>  <br> </h2> 




Social sensing has emerged as a new paradigm for collecting sensory measurements by means of "crowd-sourcing" sensory data collection tasks to a human population. Humans can act as sensor carriers (e.g., carrying GPS devices that share location data), sensor operators (e.g., taking pictures with smart phones), or as sensors themselves (e.g., sharing their observations on Twitter). The proliferation of sensors in the possession of the average individual, together with the popularity of social networks that allow massive information dissemination, heralds an era of social sensing that brings about new research challenges in this emerging field.
<p>

The objective of this workshop is to bring together researchers and engineers from academia, industry, and government to present recent advances in both theoretical and experimental research. Its scope includes social sensing, ubiquitous, mobile and pervasive sensing, participatory and opportunistic sensing, urban sensing, social signal processing, information and coding theory, information processing and knowledge discovery from sensor data, data reliability, privacy and security issues, cyber-physical-systems with human-in-the-loop. We invite technical papers describing original ideas, exciting results, and/or real-world experiences involving social sensing paradigm.
